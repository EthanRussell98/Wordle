## Wordle
#### Remake of the web-based word game Wordle using vanilla javascript.
### About
#### This application uses a random word API to get a word, the user then tries to guess this word with an on screen-keyboard. The users' guesses are validated using a dictionary API and the two words are compared, displaying each letter of the guessed word in one of three colours. Green: if the letter is in the correct place, yellow: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong place or grey: if the letter is not in the word.
